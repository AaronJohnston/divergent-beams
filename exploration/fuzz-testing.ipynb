When sunlight passes through water droplets in the air, it gets refracted and dispersed into its component colors.\\n\\nParticipant2: So, that's why we see a spectrum of colors in a rainbow?\\n\\nParticipant1: Yes, and the order of colors is always the same: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\\n\\nParticipant2: That's really interesting.

    "- It would be really useful to be able to point to WHICH tokens are most similar in the UI. So maybe want to do this on a token-by-token basis, or word part by word part basis, then do sequence matching to find the most similar subsequences? Finding units that repeat with any approximate distance N between them (where N can equal 1, covering the adjacent case) are \"interesting\" matches? But for the format examples I'm thinking about, I would want exact match more than semantic match right?\n",
