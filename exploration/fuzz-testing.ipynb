      "1. Hue: Hue refers to the color itself, or the dominant wavelength of light that determines the color we perceive. It is measured in degrees on a color wheel, with 0° representing red, 120° representing green, and 240° representing blue. Hue is the attribute that allows us to distinguish between different colors, such as red, blue, or yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Saturation: Saturation, also known as chroma or intensity, refers to the purity or intensity of a color. It measures the degree to which a color is diluted with white or gray. A fully saturated color is vivid and intense, while a less saturated color appears more muted or washed out. Saturation is typically measured on a scale from 0% (completely desaturated, or gray) to 100% (fully saturated).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Value: Value, also known as brightness or lightness, refers to the relative lightness or darkness of a color. It measures the amount of light that a color reflects or emits. A higher value indicates a lighter color, while a lower value indicates a darker color. Value is typically measured on a scale from 0% (completely black) to 100% (fully white).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, hue determines the color itself, saturation determines the intensity or purity of the color, and value determines the lightness or darkness of the color. These three components can be used to create a wide range of colors and shades, and they are particularly useful in digital image processing and design applications.\n",
